# Hi, I'm Josie (or jositom). 
I'm a transfem who's been programming for a good couple of years now.

The language I know the best is C#, though my favourite language is C. I also know Python and a little bit of Java.

Don't expect anything big or ambitious here, I program purely for fun in my free time and throw them here when I'm satisfied with them.

### Have a nice day! ❤️
